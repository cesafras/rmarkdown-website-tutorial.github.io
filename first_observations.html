</div>


<div id="what-is-this" class="section level2">
<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>One of the most oft repeated pieces of advice for aspiring writers looking for literary agents is to look at the acknowledgements section of novels to see which literary agents represent the writers they admire. From there, the advice goes, just query those agents and, with a bit of work and kismit, one day <em>you’ll</em> be the published author whose acknowledgements people are trolling.</p>
<p>Okay, then!</p>
<p>The rest of this analysis is me taking that advice… too far? Sure I could have read the acknowledgements, made my list of literary agents and gone about my business, but I had more questions. And when I have questions, I do stuff with data. (I am a novelist cum data scientist, if you recall.)</p>
<p>I created a dataset consisting of all of the debut authors that had been nominated for the Center for Fiction First Novel Prize in the past three years (2020, 2019, 2018) and did some analysis, based on… you guessed it, the contents of their acknowledgements. In a perfect world, I could do this for every single debut author, ever, but in practice I needed to limit the size of the dataset and chose this particular group of ~80 writers because it seemed like a somewhat representative cohort of fiction that I enjoy and that have also enjoyed some level of acclaim (owing to the prize nomination and all.) Why debut novelists you ask? Well, one, because that’s what I’m working toward. But two, technically speaking, it meant that writers would not be duplicated in the dataset year over year (because, you’re only a debut novelist once.) How elegant!</p>
<p>Below, I’m dropping that knowledge, for the whole world (i.e. other people writing literary fiction and looking for agents) to enjoy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who’s getting shoutouts? (aka: get you a Katie!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a few different types of entities that writers typically acknowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>agents / agencies</li>
<li>editors / publishing houses</li>
<li>MFA programs</li>
<li>Workshops / retreats / foundations</li>
<li>Friends and family</li>
</ul>
<p>For the purposes of this analysis I’ve organized these entities into three broader categories: agencies, organizations, and individuals. The charts below highlight the entities (agencies, organizations, and individuals) that were shouted out the most by the debut authors.</p>
<p>If we look across all entities we see a mix of agencies and organizations on the leaderboard. You’ll notice only one individual make the top ten overall list. That individual is none other than… <strong>Katie!</strong></p>
<p>(I found it amusing that 1 out of every 7 debut authors acknowledged someone named Katie… I know, I know, there are lots of Katies out there supporting the arts, but… it’s really hard to get into Bread Loaf or Tin House. Finding a Katie to stan my work, though? Feels more doable.)</p>

<p><img src="first_observations_files/figure-html/most_thanked_agencies-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p><img src="first_observations_files/figure-html/most_thanked_individuals-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How many people does it take to write a novel? (spoiler: a small to medium sized village)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We looked at who’s getting shoutouts, now let’s look at how many shoutouts our debut authors are giving. Below is the distribution of the number of entities thanked across all of our authors. So how big a village does it take to write a novel?</p>
<p><strong>The short answer? 30.</strong></p>
<p>Most debut novelists acknowledge 29 people or more – call it 30 if we include the author who… probably did the most work?</p>
<p>The minimum number of entities acknowledged is… 0. (Whomp whomp whomp.) And the maximum is a much more bustling village of 88.</p>
<p><img src="first_observations_files/figure-html/n_entities_thanked-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But, like, do they all have fancy MFAs and exclusive residencies? Are all these award winning debut novelists best friends? Because it kind of seems like they are on Twitter…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the question that was really gnawing at me when I started this whole exercise. As a fairly avid reader of novel acknowledgements I see the same names over and over again, which leads me to believe that novel publishing is a super exclusive closed circuit that no mere mortal can simply enter at will. But then again… I do have an active imagination (I am writer after all!) so I wanted to put my intuition to the test.</p>
<p>To do that I created a social graph based on the debut novelist’s acknowledgements section. I used a natural language processing model to extract all of the named entities from the text of each author’s acknowledgements. There are two major limitations with this approach which I will call out now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just because someone isn’t acknowledged by a writer doesn’t mean that person isn’t in that writer’s social network.</li>
<li>Our natural language processing model isn’t perfect so sometimes it
<ul>
<li>Miscategorizes entities (e.g. assumes Sewanee is a place not an organization)</li>
<li>Doesn’t fully recognize entities (e.g. Iowa is distinct from University of Iowa)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The second problem is easier to address than the first, so I did try to clean the data manually a bit, but it probably still isn’t perfect. (e.g. Curtis Brown is actually an organization but may be labeled as an individual.) But I think it’s good enough for government work. The first problem is kind of a philosophical one and I’m just going to assert here that if a writer didn’t acknowledge an entity in the approximately 2,500 words the average author allocated to their acknowledgements that entity is not in that writer’s inner circle.</p>
<p>Now onto the graph.</p>
<p>It’s color coded based on whether the entity is a:</p>
<ul>
<li>debut author</li>
<li>agency</li>
<li>other organization (e.g. workshop, residency, MFA program)</li>
<li>an individual / friend</li>
</ul>
<p>The bigger the bubble and the more central the bubble is in the chart the more important that bubble is to the social network. So the biggest bubble (Bread Loaf) represents the node in the network that is most central.</p>
<p>You can click on the bubbles to see what other entities they are connected to. You can also drag the bubbles around to see what amount of force they exert on the network. (The more the network moves with the bubble, the bigger its influence.)</p>
