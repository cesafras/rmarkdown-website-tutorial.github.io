<p><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">The graphic above is a social network constructed of the people (and organizations) mentioned in the acknowledgements sections of 80 novels longlisted for the <a href="https://centerforfiction.org/grants-awards/the-first-novel-prize/">Center for Fiction First Novel Prize</a>.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each node (bubble) in the graph is color coded based on whether the entity is a:</p>
<ul>
<li>debut author</li>
<li>agency</li>
<li>other organization (e.g. workshop, residency, MFA program)</li>
<li>an individual / friend</li>
</ul>
<p>The bigger the node and the closer the node to the center of the graph the more influential that bubble is within social network. “Influential” here just means that more novelists have mentioned that particular entity in their acknowledgements. So the biggest bubble (<a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/writers-conferences/">Bread Loaf</a>) represents the node in the network that is most influential (i.e. was mentioned by the most novelists.)</p>
<p>You can hover or click on the nodes / bubbles to see what other entities they are connected to. You can also drag the nodes around to see what amount of force they exert on the network. (The more the network moves with the node, the bigger its influence.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Background</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the most oft repeated pieces of advice for aspiring writers looking for literary agents is to look at the acknowledgements section of novels to see which literary agents represent the writers they admire. From there, the advice goes, just query those agents and, with a bit of work and kismit, one day <em>you’ll</em> be the published author whose acknowledgements people are trawling.</p>
<p>Okay, then!</p>
<p>The rest of this analysis is me taking that advice… too far? Sure I could have read the acknowledgements, made my list of literary agents and gone about my business, but… why not make it a thing?</p>
<p>So. I created a dataset consisting of all of the debut authors that had been nominated for the Center for Fiction First Novel Prize in the past three years (2020, 2019, 2018) and did some analysis, based on… you guessed it, the contents of their acknowledgements. In a perfect world, I could do this for every single debut author, ever, but in practice I needed to limit the size of the dataset and chose this particular group of ~80 writers because it seemed like a somewhat representative cohort of fiction that I enjoy and that have also enjoyed some level of acclaim (owing to the prize nomination and all.) Why debut novelists you ask? Well, one, because I am marching toward my own debut. But two, technically speaking, it meant that writers would not be duplicated in the dataset year over year, because you’re only a debut novelist once. (Anything that makes my life easier!)</p>
<p>From there I really only had a couple of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is every writer friends with every other writer, or is that a myth perpetuated by literary Twitter?</li>
<li>And speaking of literary Twitter, is <a href="https://twitter.com/alexanderchee">Alexander Chee</a> the most beloved individual in the writing community?</li>
</ul>
<p>To put my intuition to the test I constructed the social graph you see before you, which is comprised of every person, place, or thing mentioned each novel’s acknowledgements. (If the person, place or thing was only mentioned by one writer, though, I didn’t include it.) To build the dataset I used a natural language processing model to extract all of the named entities (i.e. the people, places, and things) from the text of each author’s acknowledgements. (The text content of each acknowledgement was scraped from a combination of Google Books, Amazon, and <a href="https://sfpl.axis360.baker-taylor.com/">Axis360</a>, the digital library.)</p>
<p>Note that there are two major limitations with my approach which I will call out now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just because someone isn’t acknowledged by a writer doesn’t mean that person isn’t in that writer’s social network.</li>
<li>Our natural language processing model isn’t perfect so sometimes it
<ul>
<li>Miscategorizes entities (e.g. assumes Sewanee is a place not an organization)</li>
<li>Doesn’t properly recognize entities (e.g. Iowa is distinct from University of Iowa)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The second problem is easier to address than the first, so I did try to clean the data manually a bit, but it probably still isn’t perfect. (e.g. Curtis Brown is actually an organization but may be labeled as an individual.) But I think it’s good enough for government work. The first problem is kind of a philosophical one and I’m just going to assert here that if a writer didn’t acknowledge an entity in the approximately 2,500 words the average author allocated to their acknowledgements, that that entity is not in that writer’s inner circle.</p>
<p>I hope that makes sense! (It’s actually slightly more messy / complicated than I’m making it out to be. If you’re interested in the source code, <a href="https://github.com/cesafras/vigilant-adventure/blob/gh-pages/first_observations.Rmd">here</a> it is.)</p>
<p><em>Note also: I did not really check my work, however I did watch a conversation between <a href="https://lucyrtan.com/">Lucy Tan</a> and <a href="https://www.susiebooks.com/">Susie Yang</a> (both of whose novels I’ve read; they are great!) hosted by everyone’s favorite Brooklyn bookstore <a href="https://www.booksaremagic.net/">Books Are Magic</a> in which they revealed a long-standing friendship, so the fact that they show up so close together in the graph is… super vindicating.</em></p>

<p>Basically, yes, Alexander Chee is the most popular person in the literary community.</p>
<p>Also, apply to Bread Loaf?</p>
