<p><div style="border-left: 5px solid black; padding-left: 15px;">I am seeking representation for one (or both!) version(s) of my debut novel, 
<b>EVERYTHING'S FINE</b>.</div></p>
<p>Wait, what?</p>
<p>I know, I know. TWO debut novels is a bit of a twist. But I find myself in a
situation where I have written two versions of the same novel and my goal is to
publish one... or the other... or both! The original is a coming-of-age love story
set between 2010 and 2017 and the amended version (the twist!) is the same story
but set between 1980 and 1987.</p>
<p>Initially I shifted the timeline as an exercise, a way to force some authorial,
and cultural distance between myself and the novel. Inserting my Millennial
protagonists into the 1980s required me to ask and answer some very interesting
questions at the heart of the story. It required me to examine what was at the
core of their concerns (was it really all about avocado toast?) and to ask
myself would be different and whatwould be the same? What would I do with all
of the Beyonce references? And all the text messages? What is intrinsic to a
character and what is owed to circumstance? Who would their friends be and how
would their values shift; how would they be fundamentally the same and how would
they be different? The only thing I knew when I started was that I had to change
their names. (Jessica and Joshua born in 1990 became Josephine and John born in
1960.)
</p>
<p> As I wrote into this new setting, the story evolved and unfolded.
And spoiler alert: a novel that was originally about young love, not only looked different when refracted through the prism of a different era, but also started
to tell a much bigger story about how the culture has (and hasn't) changed in
the past thirty years. So that's how I ended up with two versions of the same
novel. A V1 and a very different V2. <i><b>A distinctly Millennial love
story, but make it Boomer.</i></b> One story the echo of the other. Two stories
of very different, but similarly fraught eras.</p>

<p><b>EXCERPT</b></p>
<p>The class was <i>Supreme Court Topics</i>. Fall semester, senior year. Each week they debated a different landmark decision, and someone was always shouting. Or sharing a pointless personal anecdote. Or invoking the founding fathers to prove a stupid point. Jess hated it, but it fulfilled the undergraduate Law & Society requirement.</p>
<p>They sat around a big wooden table which was meant to foster “active dialogue,” and the discussion was student led, the format purposefully discursive, so that even if one day, for example, the syllabus said Grutter v Bollinger: Affirmative Action, it wasn’t unusual to spend half the class arguing about basketball and standardized tests until someone groaned: “Is anyone else completely bored of this debate?”</p>
<p>It was only the third week of class and Jess knew two things about the guy who had just spoken: his name was Josh and he regularly said foolish things.</p>
<p>Jess had turned and glared. Not because she wasn’t also bored of the debate, but because she could tell he was bored for the Wrong Reasons.</p>
<p>He was wearing a Choate sweatshirt, for one thing, which made her think of lawns and regattas and gin cocktails and haughty blonds. But also, it was something about his face. He reminded Jess of a stock photograph, not terrible in itself but also somehow suggesting a complete lack of internal conflict. He looked like what a fifth grader might come up with if asked to draw a “man,” all even lines and uncomplicated symmetry. Like a cable news anchor or the star of a syndicated toothpaste commercial.</p>
<p>“It’s 2011,” Josh had argued, “Why are we still having this debate? I’m not saying that discrimination isn’t real, but is throwing open the doors to elite universities is the answer? The problem is broken homes and blighted communities. That’s where policy interventions should start. In homes, in neighborhoods, in schools.”</p>
<p>“Right, okay, but this is a school,” Jess had pointed out.</p>
<p>“Whatever,” another classmate argued, “It’s reverse racism.”</p>
<p>And Jess had said, “Right, okay, if that were a thing.”</p>
<p>Another classmate: “People shouldn’t get into college just because they’re black.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Jess had replied, “because my college application was just the words ‘I’m black’ repeated one thousand times.”</p>
<p>Someone else clarified, “I think his point is that we shouldn’t take race into account at all.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. Affirmative action isn’t fair.”</p>
<p>“It’s not meritocratic.”</p>
<p>“It’s not constitutional!”</p>
<p>“It is kind of outrageous that there’s essentially a double standard based on, you know, melanin.”</p>
<p>“What about the double standard for athletes and legacies!” Jess said, “Anyone with a squash racquet and a trust fund is automatically exempt from scrutiny. No one’s asking if they’re qualified!”</p>
<p>“That’s not the same thing, and you know it.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it is.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it—”</p>
<p>The professor cleared his throat. “Let’s bring it back to the case at hand. Was Grutter’s claim valid? Or was the Court’s decision, on balance, unconstitutional?”
<p>To Jess’s right, Josh broke the fourth wall of the classroom.</p>
<p>He whispered, “Is that really your argument? That legacies and affirmative action are the same thing? I mean… really?”</p>
<p>Jess had ignored him, and pretended to pay attention as someone prattled on about why it didn’t make sense for universities to “lower the bar.”</p>
<p>He slid his elbows across the table so that his clasped hands rested on Jess’s notebook. So that she could smell the fabric softener on his sleeves. “Come on,” he had said, his voice low. “I don’t believe you believe that.”</p>
<p>Jess had picked up her pen, drawn a series of squiggles and spirals in the upper right corner of her notebook. Studiously avoided eye contact.</p>
<p>“At least you see how it’s a false equivalence, right? You do see that, don’t you?”
All Jess saw was his pale wrists, the titanium watch ticking silently with Swiss precision. His father had probably given it to him on his eighteenth birthday. Along with a fifty year old bottle of scotch and the passwords to all the brokerage accounts.
Jess had said nothing.</p>
<p>He leaned closer, “So you really think relaxing admissions standards for ‘underrepresented minorities’”—here he used air quotes, which confirmed for Jess that, yes, he was the worst—“is an acceptable mechanism by which to achieve”—more air quotes—“‘equality?’”</p>
<p>There were seventy three things she could have said to him, but there was only one that she was pretty sure would piss him off. She finally looked at him. She said: “Yes.”</p>
<p>He leaned back, surprised, “Are you serious?”</p>
<p>“Are you serious?” This conversation, it was like a garbage truck, without the emergency brake set, rolling down a steep hill: no stopping that shit.</p>
<p>“So you’re telling me that having a certain skin color is as good as possessing some demonstrable skill or talent?” he shook his head, “I don’t believe you really believe that.”</p>
<p>Yes, she really believed that. She would have said it differently, obviously, but she believed it.</p>
<p>Why didn’t he believe she believed that?</p>
<p>Why did he think that disagreeing with him was only a matter of misunderstanding?</p> 
<p>Why couldn’t he just go polish his watch and leave her alone?</p>
<p>But he wouldn’t let it go. He kept shaking his head, saying, “Don’t buy it. No way,” until Jess said: “Josh?”</p>
<p>He leaned back toward her, expectant, and Jess tugged her notebook from under his wrists, “You’re on my notes.”</p>
<p>He seemed momentarily startled, but was undeterred. “You’re essentially arguing that ‘diversity’ matters more than merit.”</p>
<p>She was losing patience. “Well you’re arguing that swinging a squash racquet is equivalent to 400 years of slavery and systemic inequality!”</p>
<p>In the classroom, conversation stopped.</p>
<p>Everyone looked over. It occurred to Jess that she wasn’t exactly whispering, wasn’t even technically using her indoor voice anymore.</p>
<p>The professor frowned, “Jess? Did you have something to add?”</p>
<p>This always happened: she got sucked in. When she would rather say nothing, sit quietly playing number puzzles on her phone under the table.</p>
<p>At the same time she accepted, begrudgingly anyway, that it was her responsibility to Say Something. This, Jess had learned from her father, who, throughout her Nebraska childhood, had always been saying something about something. Demanding that the Walmart manager stock multicultural dolls, while Jess stood behind him, mortified. Driving across state lines at Christmas to find the only black Santa in the Great Plains. Pestering the principal about the lack of books about black history in the school library.</p>
<p>Sometimes Jess wondered why he bothered. Wouldn’t have it been easier to move? Instead of yelling at her teachers for fucking up the Civil War unit? Or buying knockoff Barbies? All she wanted was to fit in, not to read another children’s biography of Dr. Martin Luther King.</p>
<p>Not to have to whisper fight with Josh, in his prep school sweatshirt with his newscaster hair; to have to defend herself, her race, her right to be there.

<p><b>EXCERPT</b></p>

<p>The class was called <i>American Sociopolitical Contexts and the Economy</i> and it was new for the ’80-’81 school year, required for all seniors with majors in Finance. Unlike their other coursework—math and economics and computational portfolio analysis—<i>Sociopolitical Contexts</i> was a student led seminar in which they discussed current events and the impact to the economy.</p>
<p>The rest of their classes were practical, tactical. They learned how to price bonds and calculate ratios, how to read balance sheets. They carried Hewlett Packard calculators in their pockets and tucked pencils behind their ears. But “soft skills” had recently become a buzzword, and so the administration had jammed the class into their senior schedules, an attempt to coax out of them some humility.</p>
<p>The markets didn’t tell the whole story, they insisted. If graduates were going to thrive in the modern economy, they would need to practice putting current events into context. It was a new decade, a new economy, they were preparing them for change!</p>
<p>Students were more skeptical. They didn’t think armchair politics could be taught. They didn’t think they needed to spend three hours a week discussing the news. Wasn’t that what cocktail parties were for? Still, they resigned themselves to the experiment.</p>
<p>Because the class was student led, there was no instructor, just a graduate assistant who sat in the back of each classroom, monitoring for attendance and civility. Instead each section was assigned a “student facilitator” who led the weekly discussions. It was an honor to be selected as facilitator, something they could put on their resumes. </p>
<p>And without a professor, it had the feeling of a secret meeting. There was swearing and innuendo, feet on the chairs. It wasn’t all bad.</p>
<p>Still, privately they referred to the class as Party Chat.</p>

<p>Despite the moniker, the class turned out to be quite popular—people liked to hear themselves talk—though Jo found it something close to unbearable.</p>
<p>She felt subjected to her classmates’ tiresome opinions in ways that she normally was not. In debating the merits of, say, share buybacks versus dividends, she could appreciate their perspectives, but in discussing the issues of the day, she could not. They were sheltered and bombastic and seemed to share the same unoriginal thoughts.</p>
<p>Besides, what context did the economy really require? In her almost four years in college, she felt she had learned everything she needed to know about the economy, by which they really meant the S&P. Namely that it was impervious. The economy, seemingly, was resilient to everything. It was not beholden to anyone, to right or wrong, to liberal or conservative, to past or precedent. It simply chugged along. Like so many other American institutions, regardless of its ability to perform its core function, which, as they told it, was to be a bellwether of American prosperity.</p>
<p>But at the moment, fifty-two Americans were being held hostage in Tehran. Still the economy chugged along. Inflation had skyrocketed to record highs—a jar of peanut butter now cost almost two dollars. Still, the economy chugged along. The Soviets invaded Afghanistan, over the summer a black insurance salesman was beaten to death by police in Miami, sparking riots, and a heatwave in the Midwest had killed two thousand people. Still, the economy chugged along.</p>
<p>What else was there to discuss, really?</p>

<p>1980 was an election year and so that was a recurring topic. The consensus in the classroom was that the election would come down to two key issues: the economy and the economy. But they couldn’t agree which was more damning: Carter’s weakness or Reagan’s veneer of idiocy.</p>
<p>Two weeks before the election, John Barrett—the student facilitator in Jo’s section—took an informal poll.</p>
<p>He stuck a hand in the air and said, “Let’s have a show of hands. Who will be supporting Reagan?” He looked around, counting, then put his hand down. “And Carter?”</p>
<p>The class was split. </p>
<p>Jo was for Carter, everyone else was not.</p>
<p>“We have a bleeding heart, I see,” John Barrett announced, then looked at Jo and added, “I do admire your naïveté.” He was laughing.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed along—not unkindly—and the conversation moved on, but still Jo’s blood boiled.</p>

<p>The week before the election all the Tuesday sections were called off, so that all of the seniors could gather in the main lecture hall to watch the presidential debate live on television.</p>
<p>It was the first, and the last time, that this particular group of students—the Finance seniors—would be assembled together until they collected their diplomas in May, and consequently the auditorium had a festive air. It was the beginning of their senior year, a new decade, and the horizon of possibilities stretched seemingly to infinity. At the same time, they were still safe, protected by the four walls of the university. And so they didn’t take any of the rest of it very seriously.</p>
<p>People smuggled in beers and bags of peanuts, as if it were Homecoming. Although it was forbidden in the classrooms, a window at the back of the room had been opened and a cluster of students sat together smoking. There was laughing, back slapping, feet on the furniture. Someone had scribbled the lyrics to a Def Leopard song on the big green chalkboard at the front of the room.</p>
<p>Eventually the overhead lights flickered on and off. A graduate assistant wheeled a television on a metal cart across the room as if he were pushing a boulder.</p>
<p>He crawled around on the floor for a moment, until he located a socket. He plugged the television in, switched it on. He adjusted the antenna until all the fuzz was gone. Finally, Ted Koppel’s face flashed on the screen and everyone piped down.</p>

<p>There were only four black students in the room—only four black seniors in the Finance department—and they sat together in a single row: Jo, then her roommate Tammy, then Nnamdi, then Raymond, who always took the aisle, and who Jo considered thoughtful and interesting, but who was also six and a half feet tall, and so spent every other breath explaining that he didn’t, in fact, play basketball. Neither of them did—the two boys—which often came as a surprise.</p>
<p>But Raymond was from Wisconsin and preferred paddleball. And Nnamdi was from Nigeria. He wore a tie and spoke with a clipped accent, and because of this, he was rumored to be an African prince. He had a way of denying this, that somehow made it seem truer.</p>
<p>Tammy had kissed both of them, Jo had kissed neither.</p>
<p>Among the four of them, they agreed that Reagan was a racist and a warmonger, but as the debate wore on, it became impossible to deny that he appeared to be neither. Even Nnamdi, the most radical among them, would later acknowledge that this was Reagan’s greatest trick: dressing heartless right wing politics up in a pleasant face and newscaster smile, spinning hawkish rhetoric of American aggression into a narrative of optimism and exceptionalism, convincing millions of vulnerable people that a cowboy, an intellectual lightweight, was fit to run the country.</p>
<p>On television Reagan was hard to argue with. He was clearheaded and confident, sonorous when he spoke. When he dismissed Carter as a hysterical nitwit it brought the house down. In the lecture hall students whooped and clapped, while the four black seniors exchanged private glances.</p>
<p>By the time the graduate assistant wheeled the television back out of the room, Jo knew that a B-list actor would become the next president.
