It's possible to create well-designed websites for free using [RStudio's R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and hosting them on [Github](http://github.com). This is very new and incredibly cool. It is a really powerful way to communicate science using the same reproducible workflow you use for your analyses and collaborations.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(networkD3)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r data, echo=FALSE}
links <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Dataset1-Media-Example-EDGES.csv")
nodes <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Dataset1-Media-Example-NODES.csv")

el <- data.frame(from=as.numeric(factor(links$from))-1,
                 to=as.numeric(factor(links$to))-1)
nl <- cbind(idn=factor(nodes$media, levels=nodes$media), nodes)
```

```{r plot, echo = FALSE}
forceNetwork(Links = el, Nodes = nl, Source="from", Target="to",
             NodeID = "idn", Group = "type.label",linkWidth = 1,
             linkColour = "#afafaf", fontSize=12, zoom=T, legend=T,
             Nodesize=6, opacity = 0.8, charge=-300,
             width = 600, height = 600)
```
